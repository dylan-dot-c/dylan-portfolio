                I was born and raised in Jamaica and recently moved to New York.
                I started coding from my late high school days where I learnt
                Pascal and C. After Highschool I continued my learning due to my
                interest in web development. WHen I got to New York I completed
                a coding bootcamp at Coding Temple which equipped me with the
                skills to become a fullStack Web Developer.
